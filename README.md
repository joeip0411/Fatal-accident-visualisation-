# Fatal-accident-visualisation
Interactive R Shiny dashboard for visualising fatal traffic accident in Victoria

Road safety is one of the essential considerations when designing and building a road network. Although the government has spent massive effort in ensuring road safety, for example, installing road safety products and implementing better designs of road, traffic accidents remain a concern to the public. This project aims to communicate the findings of analysing the crash data in Victoria between the period 2014- 2018 by using interactive data visualisations.
